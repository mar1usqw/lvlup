      <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
      <section class="card" id="core-services">
        <h2>Our Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Level Up Construct Ltd has over <strong>19 years of experience</strong> in the
          construction industry, specialising in residential and commercial refurbishment
          and fit-out projects across London and surrounding areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          We manage projects from initial planning through to final handover,
          ensuring clear communication, compliance with building regulations,
          and high standards of workmanship at every stage.
        </p>

      <!-- WARRANTY -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Warranty & Quality Assurance</h2>

        <p>
          All our projects are backed by a clear contractor warranty, providing
          confidence and peace of mind for our clients.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Residential building warranty covering <strong>structural elements</strong></li>
          <li>A <strong>simple and efficient claims process</strong>, not reliant on proof of negligence</li>
          <li><strong>Project-specific warranty coverage</strong> for each build</li>
          <li>A <strong>transparent and straightforward underwriting process</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A typical contractor warranty confirms that no defects or deficiencies
          will develop in the construction work for a defined period, usually
          <strong>12 months</strong>. During this time, we commit to returning to site
          to repair or replace any defective work promptly and professionally.
